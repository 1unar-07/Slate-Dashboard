Slate Dashboard
This is a React-based dashboard project with dynamic charts and role-specific views (Admin, School, Parent, Student). It is designed for managing student achievements and other related data.

Getting Started
This project was bootstrapped with Create React App.

Available Scripts
In the project directory, you can run the following commands:

npm start
Runs the app in development mode. Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes, and you may also see any lint errors in the console.

npm test
Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode.

For more information about running tests, refer to the section about running tests.

npm run build
Builds the app for production into the build folder. It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified, and the filenames include hashes. Your app is ready to be deployed!

npm run eject
Note: This is a one-way operation. Once you eject, you can't go back!

If you're not satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can eject at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc.) right into your project so you have full control over them. All commands except eject will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point, you're on your own.

You don't need to use eject unless you're ready for it. For small and medium-sized projects, the curated feature set is usually sufficient.
